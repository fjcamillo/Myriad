# Myriad

Smart Fire Alarm System for an Inclusive Fire Prevention, Detection and Rescue

Works on 3 Levels
- 1. Detection
- 2. Alert
- 3. Centralized Information Dissiminiation 

Myriad is our submission to the IOT Summit Hackathon 2016. It comprises of a hardware and software integration solution.

Hardware:
On the hardware we used a raspberry pi connected to a monitor so that images about the fire could be seen. We also used an arduino mega, MQ3 Sensor, Gas Sensor, Smoke Sensor as data gatherers for the smoke prevention and detection module.

Software:
On the software side, we used the Chikka API to send information on alerts, created using python
